# Research Question

- WHO about stroke

After a stroke occurs, every minute counts. The sooner the affected person 
receives medical care, the higher the chances of a good recovery and little 
subsequent damages. Thus it is key to recocgnize a stroke occured. Besides
knowledge about the visible symptoms of a stroke, knowledge about who is at 
high(er) risk to suffer a stroke can help channeling valuable attention 
resources on the right people.

Therefore, in my project I will work with the research question which medical 
or lifestyle factors can be associated with a higher stroke risk and which
statistical model is most appropriate to predict stroke occurences.


# Data

The data with which I will investigate my research question is publically
accessible via kaggle.com. The dataset is called "Stroke Prediction Dataset", 
uploaded on the 26th of January 2021 by the user fedesoriano 
(https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset). 
Unfortunately, no further sources for the data or information about the 
collection methodology or author are given. Thus, the validity of the data is 
uncertain and conclusions should be drawn with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, 
the data superficially seems fit to investigate the research question.

The dataset includes information about 5110 people. There is demographic data 
(age, gender), medical data (Hypertension, Heart Disease, Glucose Level, 
BMI, Stroke), and lifestyle data (Marriage, Work Type, Residence Type, Smoking 
Status).
